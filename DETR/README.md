**MVVTR**: Multi-view Vision Transformer for object detection 
========

PyTorch training code and pretrained models for **MVVTR** (**DE**tection **TR**ansformer).
We 

**What it is**. Unlike traditional computer vision techniques, 

**About the code**. We believe that object detection should not be more difficult than classification,
and should not require complex libraries for training and inference.


# Notebooks

We provide a few notebooks in colab to help you get a grasp on DETR:
* [DETR's hands on Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/detr/blob/colab/notebooks/detr_attention.ipynb): Shows how to load a model from hub, generate predictions, then visualize the attention of the model (similar to the figures of the paper)
* [Standalone Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/detr/blob/colab/notebooks/detr_demo.ipynb): In this notebook, we demonstrate how to implement a simplified version of DETR from the grounds up in 50 lines of Python, then visualize the predictions. It is a good starting point if you want to gain better understanding the architecture and poke around before diving in the codebase.
* [Panoptic Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/detr/blob/colab/notebooks/DETR_panoptic.ipynb): Demonstrates how to use DETR for panoptic segmentation and plot the predictions.
